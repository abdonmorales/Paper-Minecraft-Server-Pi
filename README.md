# This is the vanilla branch for a vanilla Minecraft Server

To setup or run the jar, run the following command (once you untar the 1.3 stable release):

`java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar minecraft_server.1.17.jar nogui`

**After running the command, open the file `eula.txt` and replace `false` with `true`**

Should you want to start the server with its graphical user interface you can leave out the "nogui" part.

You can also change the amount of RAM that is reserved for the Minecraft Server by modifying the GB of RAM in command (to start the server)

### This release of MC Server 1.3 and 1.3.X is based on vanilla Minecraft 1.17.X
## ⚠️ Warning! Minecraft 1.17 and onward requires Java 15 and higher
